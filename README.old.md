## Introduction

You have an storage device that would allow you to get access to the 7,002 Bitcoins, however you threw away the piece of paper you wrote down your PIN on.  
You storage device gives users limited number of guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever.

You need to guess the correct PIN within the allotted attempts or you will lose all your Bitcoin.  
Luckily, your storage device has a special feature that will tell you if you guessed any of the numbers correctly. It tells you if you guessed any digits correctly, but does not tell how many you guessed correctly or which digit you guessed correctly.
